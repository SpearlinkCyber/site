## üéØ Penetration Testing
  
**Find vulnerabilities that actually matter to your business**
  
Penetration testing focused on real-world attack scenarios and business impact. Rather than producing generic checklists, every assessment is tailored to your specific application, user base, and threat landscape. The goal is identifying vulnerabilities that could genuinely harm your organisation and providing clear, actionable guidance to fix them.

**What Makes This Different:**
- **Business Context First** - Vulnerabilities are prioritised by actual business risk, not just technical severity
- **Real-World Attack Focus** - Testing methodology targets genuine attack vectors, not just compliance checkboxes
- **Quality Over Quantity** - Focus on meaningful findings with clear exploitation scenarios and business impact
- **Actionable Reporting** - Detailed remediation guidance that development teams can actually implement

**Typical Outcomes:**
- Clear vulnerability assessment with genuine business risk context
- Detailed remediation guidance with implementation priorities and timelines
- Executive summary for management and technical detail for development teams
- Follow-up consultation to verify fixes and answer questions about implementation
